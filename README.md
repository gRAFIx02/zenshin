# Zenshin

First project using a public API.

## Introduction

The project is based on my favourite game **Genshin Impact**. The project fetches a random character information from a public API named [Gshimpact API](https://gshimpact.vercel.app/), then displays the character information including their picture. The pictures were sourced separately and included in the "public" directory as the API didn't contain any entry of their photos.

## Tech Stack

``Node.js`` ``Express.js`` ``EJS`` ``Axios``

## Installation Guide

Use ``npm i`` to install the necessary modules.

If you want to install the updated packages at once, use the following commands:
``npm init -y``
``npm i express ejs axios``
